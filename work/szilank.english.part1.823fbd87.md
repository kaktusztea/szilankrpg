# Shard RPG ([CC](LICENSE))

A complete tabletop (paper, dice) role-playing game system designed for fantasy worlds.

## **[Rule System](md/szabalyrendszer.md)** ⚜️

<br />

## Philosophy

The `Shard RPG` is a fantasy role-playing game that strives for realism, yet feels fluid during gameplay. This is because we have relegated most calculation-heavy tasks to character creation time, and an advanced [Character Creator](md/szabalyrendszer.md#character-creator----helper) assists in calculating statistics - allowing for an extremely unique and specialized final result.

The priority is always the atmosphere of the mystical, adventurous story and its characters - the system is just a "second fiddle" - it serves the storyteller and provides a fixed framework. The envisioned environment is one where a novel-like, dramatic role-playing game can be realized, strongly supported from the background by the "subtle" rule system. This system provides a broad framework for creativity, and then recedes into the background. It is best if the "fence" woven by the rules is so wide that the player feels they are in an infinite forest full of possibilities, not in a pine grove enclosed by a fence. This type of system is more dangerous than the softly enveloping arms of a narrative system, but perhaps we can experience a greater sense of freedom with it. It is important that the flow of the adventure is not solely guided by the dice - a single random bad roll should not cause a character's demise. The system should be for the players and not the other way around.

Despite the numerous rules, in many places, you will not find actions that require calculation, so the system rewards unique ideas more, and the freedom of non-dice-rolling situations places more emphasis on the **role**-playing aspect.

However, when a player has a good idea or a tactical thought, they are given well-defined rules and tools to implement it. During more complex events, the calculation burdens are consciously distributed between the player and the storyteller (Game Master, GM). Unburdening the GM is a particularly important aspect, assisted by several "semi-finished" values that the GM and players can calculate in advance (even before rolling) - thus speeding up the game.

Rewarding player creativity to a high degree is very important - this is achieved by emphasizing the different nature of situations, where clever solutions and good situational awareness can provide a great advantage in combat situations (as well).

## Combat System

Tactical, situational, epic. Perhaps these three terms best describe the `Shard` combat system.

As mentioned above, we heavily rely on the differences in situations: the same two characters, under different circumstances, with different weapons, armor, and tactics, will have radically different chances. Thus, those who fight with their wits can gain a lot. Teamwork and situation-dependent, tactical thinking - like in a small special forces unit - can achieve quite powerful consequences, such as a well-aimed dagger thrust causing a complete victory at the right time and with proper preparation. A problem can have multiple solutions, and with enough cunning, you can even achieve your goal by avoiding combat altogether.

In other words, marching into the middle of a field and engaging in a frontal assault - as in video games - is strongly discouraged. Nevertheless, we try to preserve the epic nature and are not aiming for hyper-realism in combat.

Use your environment's features and the given circumstances to create an advantageous situation! In combat, you can gain an advantage - or your opponents can - by cleverly combining the following factors.

⚜️ Combat Situations: These are given or created situations that modify the base combat values.

⚜️ Combat Tactics: Consciously applied combat styles and tendencies that a character can use during combat.

⚜️ Maneuvers: Unique, special tricks that cause a specific effect or change in combat (Disarm, Shield Bash, etc.) and are always directed against a specific opponent.

⚜️ Combat Feats: Specialized, learnable knowledge that provides a constant advantage through a thorough understanding of `1-1` specific areas.

⚜️ Weapon Size Categories: Bigger weapon, bigger advantage... until you are forced into a tight space.

⚜️ Superior Numbers. Fighting against multiple attackers is increasingly difficult in the `Shard` system - often, putting on your running shoes is the best idea.

---
## Ranged Combat System

Firearms are extremely deadly up to medium range, but armor and circumstances also play a significant role in counteracting this (and not only this).

Ranged combat is nuanced by many other factors, such as the nature of the target's movement, its size, visibility, and the effect of the wind.

---
## Adaptability

The system is well-adaptable to other, even modern, settings.

In ranged combat, simply by changing a weapon's [Aiming Value](md/071_tavharc_ce.md) and [Divisor](md/072_tavharc_ve_oszto_cella.md) characteristic - you can have a sniper rifle with a scope.

The skill system can be excellently adapted to other worlds by defining new [Free Feats](md/042_szabad_fortelyok.md).

---
## Mystical Worldview

During development, we encountered the following dilemma:
Should the mystical worldview be world-dependent, or on the contrary, independent? If it is world-dependent, we will be severely constrained during development. If it is independent, the result will be such a general, "watered-down" system that it has no roots to tie it to the specific world we are playing in - we threw the baby out with the bathwater.

We cut the Gordian knot in the following way:
We chose Yn3v's magical and mystical world, but it is "merely" an inspiration for us. The gods, otherworldly beings, their legends, and history provide a good framework, and we keep these, but the functioning of magic, sacred forces, and the use of spiritual energies are not tied to the previous system - they can be rewritten and redefined by us in a unique way at any time if we see it as more atmospheric and better fitting our vision.

So, if someone orthodoxly clings to the old M* world - they may be disappointed. Those who are open to new things, come with us!

---
## Magic

In mystical elements, a strong emphasis was placed on the atmospheric and situation-dependent aspects and the unpredictability of magic: magic is NOT an alternative physics. The same spell can behave differently, or be easier/harder depending on the circumstances/conjunctions/user's person/power. Some spells can be physically exhausting.

In magic, minor/major side effects appear, especially with powerful spells. In priestly magic, the current "influence" of the respective god in the world matters a lot; priests cannot be considered equal in terms of power.

---
## Social Skills

The **Etiquette**, **Influence**, and **Insight** skills cover this set of knowledge, but situations like persuasion, intimidation, or deception cannot be resolved purely with an **Influence** vs. **Insight** dice roll - a lot depends on the dialogue between the GM and the player, as well as the imagined characters. Related feats can further ease the roll, but they cannot replace the role-playing part. For more details, see the description of the [Influence](md/kepzettsegek.primer.altalanos/befolyasolas.md) skill, specifically the introduction of the [Role-playing Modifier](md/kepzettsegek.primer.altalanos/befolyasolas.md#-role-playing-modifier).

The system, therefore, emphasizes **_role-playing_** - in contrast to, for example, a computer game where every social situation is resolved with a dice roll. We considered it important to give special treatment to one of the greatest advantages of live gaming.

# Overview

Welcome to the pages of the `Shard` role-playing game system!

Before we dive into the rules and the character creation process, let's get oriented a bit. What is this system, where did it come from, when did it start, and why? What are its main features, and who is it intended for?

We also offer some useful advice to avoid classic mistakes that often occur during role-playing.

This is followed by a brief overview of the system's structure, philosophy, and the symbols used in the document. Finally, we conclude the chapter with a collection of Combat Links to speed up the game.

The rule system's original, authentic source is located at this URL: https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/

## The History of the Shard System's Development

The development of the system began in the mid-2000s, initially only as unique house rules written on top of the newly released `D20` M* (large white) publication. After it started to outgrow itself, we realized that a form rebuilt from the ground up would be appropriate to create the system we loved.

`Shard` does not aim to replace the official rule system, nor does it try to maintain relative rule and atmospheric compatibility with the old system. `Shard` is made for advanced players who do not care about attachment to the old, and are happy to try a system without compromises and "nostalgia."

Over the years, we developed and discarded several "core engines" (this is especially true for the skill system). The goal is to integrate the individual subsystems into a well-performing, not overly complicated, yet logical unit, as well as to fill long-painful gaps or correct annoying illogicalities that cause problems in many RPG systems.

Below is a brief timeline, marking the main milestones of the system's development:

<br />

### 2005.05.31: The Beginnings

- The system's first name was `gm20`
- First document containing house rules: [2005-05-31_haziszabalyok_0v2.pdf](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/raw/master/archive/history/2005-05-31_haziszabalyok_0v2.pdf?raw=true)

<br />

### 2005.05.31 - 2005.12.31

June 2005 🔆 was the period when - in just over a month - the concepts of `DV` reduction, wound categories, and the structure of the ranged combat system were born.

States from this period:

- [2005-07-10 km20_0v9.pdf](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/raw/master/archive/history/2005-07-10_km20_0v9.pdf?raw=true)
- [2005-08-01 km20_import_v0.pdf](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/raw/master/archive/history/2005-08-01_km20_import_v0.pdf?raw=true)
- [2005-10-19 km20b_0v2.4.2.pdf](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/raw/master/archive/history/2005-10-19_km20b_0v2.4.2.pdf)
- [2005-12-31 km20_karlap_0.62.ods](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/raw/master/archive/history/2005-12-31_km20_karlap_0.62.ods?raw=true)

<br />

### 2006.05.09

Until this point, development was carried out in private documents and via email.

The last such document: [2006-05-09 km20_0v3.0.1.pdf](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/raw/master/archive/history/2006-05-09_km20_0v3.0.1.pdf?raw=true)

<br />

### July 2006

The system's new name became `gm100` - at this time, we switched to `d100` based rolls in the combat system.

This month, the [gm100 Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/g/km100) developer group was launched.

**At this time, the main characteristics of the development status:**

  - Traditional class system remains
  - Attributes and the distribution system are complete
  - Skill system is almost complete
  - Combat system: still incomplete
  - The Maneuvers and Ranged Combat chapters are mostly complete
  - Feats exist, but are incomplete
  - Class feats exist, but are incomplete
  - Psionics: exists at the idea level
  - Magic: exists at the idea level

<br />

### 2008.08.14❗

End of the first major development era❗

🔆 **total: 3 years, 3 months** 🔆

The last state of the documents at this time: [2009-02-22_km100_develop.zip](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/raw/master/archive/history/2009-02-22_km100_develop.zip?raw=true)

Active development lasted until this point. By then, the system's foundations were in a fairly advanced state. Later, this was revised and refined, with the fundamentals changing relatively rarely.

**Changes compared to the previous state:**
- No classes
- Skill system is complete
- Combat system is `d100` based

<br />

---

<br />

⏸️ 13.5 year hiatus ⏸️

<br />

---
### 2022.07.18

Start of `gm100` document migration
- Manual conversion of odt documents to **markdown** format and stored under the [gm100 Github repository](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg)
- [Developer wiki](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/wiki): the wiki page associated with the Github repo became the "furnace" where ideas, TODOs, and ISSUE items are grouped, and working documents are developed.

<br />

### 2023.12.17

ODT, TXT, external note files → MARKDOWN MIGRATION COMPLETE.

Old files [archived](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/tree/master/archive).

<br />

### 2023.12.29

First Github release: [v0.4.0.0](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/releases/tag/0.4.0.0)

<br />

### January 2024 ❗

At this time - after the document migration - active development and test games with the system's current state restarted.

Weekly Github Releases are published: [more info](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/releases)

<br />

### 2024.05.01

Switch to `YEAR.WEEK` versioning with this release: [v24.18](https://github.com/kaktusztea/szilankrpg/releases/tag/24.18)

<br />

### 2025-02-14

We introduce the name **`Shard RPG`**, abandoning the old `gm100` name.

<br />

### 2025-08-28

Switch (back) to the `d20` based combat system.

## Introduction

What will you find in this rule system? If you proceed from the beginning in order - and this is recommended - we will first help you create your character for the game in the [Character Creation](010_00_karakteralkotas.md) chapter.

In the [Combat System](060_00_harcrendszer.md) chapter, we detail the rules and tactics of armed or ranged combat. You can expand your mystical powers in the [Magic System](100_magiarendszer.md) chapters.

The [Healing, Recovery](140_gyogyitas_gyogyulas.md) chapter models the regeneration of your suffered wounds, and the [Poison System](150_meregrendszer.md) may be interesting for those who prefer more subtle solutions.

We have dedicated a special chapter to [Situations](160_szituaciok.md), so you won't be without guidance during classic challenges, such as [Sensing, Perception](szituaciok/erzekeles_eszleles_aktiv_passziv.md) - which is perhaps the most common opposed test situation you will encounter during your adventures.

The system is well-adaptable to non-fantasy, modern worlds by defining new, ad-hoc [Free Feats](042_szabad_fortelyok.md) as extensions of skills and by defining the [Ranged Combat Divisor](072_tavharc_ve_oszto_cella.md) for firearms (Sniper Rifle: `10`).

## Advice

Obviously, every Game Master and party is different, but a few pieces of advice can help make the game run more smoothly when using the `Shard` system.

<br />

---
### "Not a buffet"

A familiar situation is when, faced with an obstacle, a player says the following:

- "I have xyz, zxy, etc... skills, and wqz feat" - doing all this without mentioning the skill levels and feat degrees.

In this case, the lazy player would leave it to the GM to **select** what might be helpful from the listed knowledge - as if from a buffet. What's peculiar is that they don't even indicate the extent of their knowledge, as if there were no difference between a `level 3` riding skill and a `level 12` one.

As a GM, at this point (or at the beginning of the game), politely inform the players that in a given situation, they should **name** the knowledge they wish to use AND its extent (level, degree) - thus taking a greater part in the game and less of a burden on the GM.

<br />

---
### Characters are not machines

Players often easily distance themselves from their characters, their difficulties, viewing them as some kind of perpetually moving avatar.

In such cases, you can use several GM tools, for example, to convey exhaustion. Combat without real rest seriously tests even adventurers. If you feel like an endless grind is going on, you can randomly distribute [Fatigue Points (FP)](061_02_faradsag_pont.md) at certain intervals, the accumulation of which will eventually show in their combat values.

<br />

---
### The GM is not a rulebook

During a session, the bottleneck is always the GM - they describe the environment, personify the [Non-Player Characters](010_11_njk.md), and simulate the events of the imaginary world.

If you can't remember a rule, don't put another burden on the poor GM's back by trying to squeeze the rules out of them - look it up in the rulebook yourself, and if possible, prepare in advance.

## Character Creation Introduction

What is the nature of Shard characters?

An important difference from other, traditional systems is that Shard characters **do not have classes** or a default set of knowledge, so you must define all their characteristics from scratch - however, this also gives much greater freedom, even if it involves more calculation. The automated [Character Creator](010_02_karakteralkoto_ods.md) provides immense help in this latter aspect.

When you create a character, you first imagine their appearance, personality, origin, what they are good at, what knowledge they have learned in their career so far, and then come their characteristics modeled with numbers.

If you want to jump right into the middle, the [Creating an Example Character](010_12_peldakarakter_megalkotasa.md) chapter shows the process step by step. However, it might be worthwhile to read the preceding chapters first.

### Character's Experience Level



[1; 21] Experience level
Level 3: zero point


First, you need to determine the character's [Experience Level](010_04_tsz_szintlepes.md). In the `Shard` system, you can play a character within the `[1; 21]` level interval, where **Experience Level 3** symbolizes the "zero point," the average, everyday, novice character, which other role-playing games describe as a `level 1` adventurer.

This philosophy (`level 3` is the zero point) will be echoed in other areas of the rule system - such as skill knowledge.

How many levels the GM allows at the start depends solely on them and the agreement of the party's players. You can start a life path game from the very beginning (in which case `EL 3` is recommended), or you can jump straight into adventures requiring higher-level characters.

<br />

---
### Determining Attributes



[-5; 5]


Next, you need to determine the values of your `8` unique [Attributes](010_05_01_00_tulajdonsagok_listaja.md) in the `[-5; 5]` interval by distributing **Attribute Points**. The above interval can be modified by the unique characteristics of [Races](021_faj_hatterek.md).

<br />

---
### Calculating Character Points

Your [Character Points](010_07_kp.md) (`CP`) allow you to acquire various knowledge (skills, feats, Combat Modifiers (CM/AM)). Be careful that [Secondary CP](010_07_kp.md) can only be spent on [Secondary Knowledge](010_09_primer_szekunder_ismeretek.md).

<br />

---
### Acquiring Skills



[0; 15] level


Now, review the [List of Skills](030_01_kepzettseglista.md), and then you can start spending `CP` on them. The cost of each skill level [increases exponentially](030_05_kepzettsegszintek_kp_igenye.md) as you move up the `0-15` scale. `Level 3` here also represents the "zero point," below which penalties are more likely. Many skills have - typically - Attribute requirements, which you can find in the description of the respective skills. The [Combat Styles](030_01_kepzettseglista.md#combat-skills-🅿️) used in battles, [Psionic Use](kepzettsegek.primer.misztikus/pszi_hasznalat.md), and the [Magical Spheres and Arcana](106_magikus_szferak_arkanumok.md) used in spellcasting are also such skills. Magical and priestly [Traditions](050_tradiciok.md) are also skills.

<br />

---
### Acquiring Feats



[1; 4] degree


You can also spend your Character Points on acquiring [Feats](040_fortelyok.md), which can vary in degree from `[1-4]`. These provide "narrow," certain knowledge rather than broadly scalable abilities, or they can strengthen an existing aspect of a skill - typically by giving a `+2` bonus per degree.

[Special Feats](041_kiemelt_fortelyok.md) give three unique pieces of knowledge for which you don't have to spend `CP`.

[Free Feats](042_szabad_fortelyok.md) - of which you get `1` **for free** per Experience Level - are specialized knowledge that [extend](030_08_01_kepzettsegek_fortelyok_kapcsolata.md#2-extending-skills-with-feats) one or more skills.

The [Psionic Application](fortelyok.misztikus/pszi_kiterjesztes.md) is also found among the Feats.

It is important to highlight the [Master Weapon](fortelyok.harci/mesterfegyver.md) combat feat, which encompasses the more effective use of a specific weapon.

<br />

---
### Combat/Aiming Modifiers (CM/AM)

[Combat/Aiming Modifiers (CM, AM)](062_04_hm_cm.md) symbolize the growth of general combat experience and are also acquired by spending `CP`.

<br />

---
### Acquiring Backgrounds

[Backgrounds](020_hattererek.md) can endow your character with many interesting aspects. They mostly serve a flavoring role and do **not** cost `CP`.

- By taking a [Race Background](021_faj_hatterek.md), you can determine your character's race - their attribute limitations, sensory-related feats, and race-mysteries are all grouped under this background.
- [Descriptive Backgrounds](022_leiro_hatterek.md): one-word characteristics that color the character's personality and background - can be taken as desired.
- [Karma Backgrounds](023_karma_hatterek.md): characteristics received due to events or special actions performed during adventures.

<br />

---
### Derived Values

Next come the calculations of [Derived Values](010_10_00_szarmaztatott_ertekek.md). These characteristics do not cost separate points; we calculate them from the values of the character's existing knowledge:

- [Health Points and Fatigue Points](010_10_01_ep_fp.md)
- [Maneuver Points](066_02_manover_pontok.md)
- [Magic Resistance](010_10_04_magiaellenallas.md)
- [Poison Resistance](010_10_05_meregellenallas.md)

Finally, comes the [determination of your character's combat values](062_01_ke_te_ve_ce.md) based on your combat knowledge values.

<br />

---
### Building Magic Knowledge

Let's use a "tree" analogy.

The "trunk," the **foundation**, is the acquisition of a [Magic Tradition](051_00_magia_tradiciok.md) skill, which determines the nature of magic your character will use, what "tradition" they follow.

The "branches" of the tree are the [Magical Spheres or Arcana](106_magikus_szferak_arkanumok.md) skills. These are the schools of magic that your character has learned under that Tradition and is capable of using in its context. The name of the learned Arcanum may be the same, but an "Astral Magic Arcanum" contains different formulas under [High Magic](051_01_magasmagia.md) and, for example, [Vulgar Magic](051_02_vulgarmagia.md).

Finally, come the [Mystical and Magic Feats](045_misztikus_magia_fortelyok.md), which are the "leaves" on the branches of the tree. These include [Spellcasting Forms](104_varazslas_formak.md) and other mystical, flavoring, and specializing knowledge.

<br />

---
### Recommended Optional Character Creation Process

The process below is most recommended for character-focused players who don't just want to play with a number-based killing machine but want to create "living, breathing" characters.

We proceed from the abstract and flavoring knowledge towards the "power-gaming" direction. The determination of combat and mystical knowledge happens at the very end of the process.

- `1.` Developing the character's backstory - without numbers
- `2.` Defining the character's nature and personality
- `3.` Selecting Free Feats
- `4.` Spending Secondary CP
- `5.` Spending regular CP (remember, these can also be spent on secondary knowledge!)

## Character Creator ODS

Creating a `Shard` character can be significantly expedited by using the **Character Creator**, which is an OpenDocument ods file (the open-source equivalent of Excel). The most current version of this can always be found at the top of the [home page](szabalyrendszer.md#character-creator----helper).

To use it, you need to install **[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download/)**, as Microsoft Office unfortunately does not handle the [OpenDocument](https://groups.oasis-open.org/communities/tc-community-home2?CommunityKey=4bf06d41-79ad-4c58-9e8e-018dc7d05da8) standard well...

### Editing Tips

On the interface, under the various themed tabs, the fields marked with **light yellow** can be modified; everything else is calculated automatically. Selectable elements (skills, feats, backgrounds, weapons) are all available from drop-down menus, and numerical values should be entered using the numeric keypad. Numerous active validation functions operate on the interface to prevent the entry of invalid values.

### Validation Functions, Automations

The Character Creator checks the requirements for some key - mainly combat - skills and feats. These are already included on the interface by default, but for those that are not entered, we must currently check the requirements ourselves.

The `CP` expenditures, `CM/AM` limits, Combat Styles, Two-Weapon Fighting, Master Weapon bonuses, Armor values, `HP` table numbers, etc., are all calculated automatically.

## Adventurers

The **Adventurer** soul is special. In each one slumbers the ✨[Shard](010_06_szilank.md)✨, which endows every bearer with a restless, constantly adventure-seeking nature.

This is also the reason why an **adventurous-souled** elf behaves similarly to another adventurer, even of a different race - they stand out among their own kind. Thus, the bearers of adventurer souls, regardless of their incarnation (what body they are born into), behave somewhat similarly.

The system treats every **Player Character (PC)** as an Adventurer. The uniqueness of Adventurers in the `Shard` system also appears numerically - each of them possesses the following three special characteristics.

---
### [Faster Healing](140_gyogyitas_gyogyulas.md)

Compared to other mortals, Adventurers heal faster. In the rule system, under the [Healing, Recovery](140_gyogyitas_gyogyulas.md) chapter, you will find the values that apply to them.

---
### [Shard](010_06_szilank.md)

The Shard mentioned in the introduction has reality-shaping power. We also quantify this; as a narrative element, it helps adventurers during the game. For more details, see its description.

---
### [Maneuver Points](066_02_manover_pontok.md)

As an Adventurer or a [Guardian](010_03_02_orszem_karakterek.md), the character sometimes gives a boost to their combat luck by using the above points.

## Guardian Characters

Besides Adventurers, another special, distinct soul type holds a special place on the plane of existence.

While the Adventurer's life element is movement, the Guardian character is its static opposite: the master of a specific area. This could be a temple, a city, a region, a forgotten sacred or magical place.

### Examples

- Amund high priest
- Djinn emir
- Infamous, bloodthirsty baron who maintains power over his empire by consorting with otherworldly forces
- The ancient shaman of a goblin horde
- A bound demon
- A dragon in the hoard of its treasure

## Backstory, Personality

## Personality, Social Characteristics

When creating a character, it is highly recommended to elaborate on the following:

How communicative, introverted, extroverted they are, what kind of mood they exude, whether they are teasing, and so on.

How emotionally rich are they? The **Willpower** and **Perception** **Attributes** only provide a point of reference, a framework for this.

Some of the characteristics listed above have been collected and can be taken as "free," so-called [Descriptive Backgrounds](022_leiro_hatterek.md) (also on the "Special" tab of the [Character Creator](szabalyrendszer.md#character-creator----helper)) to further color the character. These can be freely expanded (in part) after consultation with the GM and the player.

There are no detailed restrictions; the character's appearance can be freely determined. If someone is, for example, ugly, they will have a harder time making friends; if they are beautiful, they will have many envious people, so just be sensible...

## Equipment



Equipment Frame:
  2 + Strength
Medium item: 1 point
Large item: 2 points


A character can carry "any number" of tiny or small items within reasonable limits - we do not track these.

How many **medium** and **large** items you can carry without their weight hindering you is determined by the **Equipment Frame**, which is your `Strength` Attribute plus `+2`.

The **medium** and **large** items you carry deduct from this frame as follows:



-1 point: medium item
  → shortsword, 20m rope..
-2 points: large item
  → halberd, large shield..


Each overflowing point that brings the **Equipment Frame** into the negative causes the following effect per point:



-1 AV / MPF
-1 Combat Frame / MPF


🔆 Worn armor does NOT count towards the equipment deductions above - for that, we use the armor's MPF value.

## Experience Level, Leveling Up



Max experience level: 21


A character's "development" is characterized by the absolutely subjective "**Experience Level**" value. The higher someone's level, the more time they could have spent learning, the more they have experienced.

The first `2` experience levels can be considered part of the backstory. If the party does not want to play this out, it is recommended to start at `level 3` - unlike in other systems, this provides the "starting adventurer" life experience. A further advantage of this is that it makes it easier to represent the lower abilities of `1st` and `2nd` level **Non-Player Characters** (NPCs) in the system.

A character's development - thanks to experiences gained during their adventures - is naturally continuous, but to facilitate administration, we use the concept of "Leveling Up." Leveling up occurs when the GM deems that the character has significantly developed, experienced a lot, and it is time for this to be reflected in their values - at which point they announce their level up.

The player can then increase certain values of their character according to the rules defined in character creation, using so-called **Character Points** (`CP`), which they receive again at this time. For more details on spending these points, see the [Character Points (CP)](010_07_kp.md) chapter.

Someone who lives their life peacefully, without challenges, novelties, or tribulations, does not experience much and at most reaches `level 5-6` by the end of their life.

In the `Shard` system, the maximum achievable experience level is `21`.

Guidelines for character levels:



Level 1
  Inexperienced apprentice
  at the start of their journey
Level 3
  Novice. In other systems,
  this is level 1
Level 6:
  Experienced apprentice.
  A soldier with a few years of experience.
  An experienced wizard's apprentice.
Level 9:
  Journeyman. An experienced warrior,
  an acclaimed magic-user.
Level 12
  Master. A renowned warrior,
  a fearsome magic-user.
Level 15
  Grandmaster. A celebrated general,
  a dreaded magitor, a high priest.
Level 18
  A world-famous legend.
Level 21
  A shaper of eras.

## List of Attributes



[-5; +5]
max +7 with racial/magical modifiers


When you create a character, you imagine their appearance and dream up their internal characteristics that shade their personality. Describing some of their strong physical, mental, and emotional personality traits with a numerical value greatly facilitates getting a superficial, general picture of the character.

Later on, these numbers will form the basis for the character's other, more complex characteristics and numerical values, so it is advisable to define them very carefully. The description of the above basic values is done with the so-called **Attributes**, of which we define `8` different ones.

It's important to note: Willpower should not be confused with upbringing. For example, the barbarians of the southern steppes have high Willpower despite reacting with an immediate punch to insults against their ancestors - this stems from their upbringing.

+3/+4
  Could be a famous general, a renowned

  The above does not affect magical

## ⚪ Perception

Perception partly represents the sensing of the outside world's (mostly other beings') vibrations. Additionally, to a lesser extent, it also symbolizes emotional richness, but the "detecting" aspect is the prominent component.

It is an important component of artistic skills and [Insight](kepzettsegek.primer.altalanos/emberismeret.md), and paired with the [Perception skill](kepzettsegek.primer.altalanos/eszleles.md), we also perform physical world sensing and perception tests with it (Intuition, Sight, Hearing, Smell, Touch, Taste). It can also be useful for skills related to animals, such as [Riding](kepzettsegek.szekunder/lovaglas.md) or [Aerial Riding](kepzettsegek.szekunder/leglovaglas.md).

It is also an important attribute for all arts. Characters like singers do not perform well with low Perception; if a character still does such a thing, they will be the one who gets 10 minutes at the village festival and is then forgotten.

Sensual seduction also greatly benefits from Perception, and priests, shamans, witches, and special magical disciplines - astral magic, spiritualism, chaos schools - are known to operate with this Attribute.



-5
  There is them and... no one else. Completely
  insensitive, like a machine. Their family
  can be wiped out before their eyes, and it
  won't stir anything in them.
  A monster. They would find the arts completely
  meaningless if they bothered with
  them. But they don't. External stimuli
  don't reach them.




-4/-3
  Most things leave them cold,
  often paired with low internal motivation.
  Completely immune to the vibrations of others,
  for them, only their own present exists,
  they don't even try to interpret external effects.
  Nothing moves them, except maybe the
  death of a family member - a little. "Insensitive
  brute" they say. Their senses are severely underdeveloped.




-2/-1
  Has no sense for capturing moods,
  shouldn't even try magic, psionics, or arts.
  The personalities and motivations of others
  are opaque to them.
  Their senses are weak.




0 Average




+1/+2
  A sensitive type, has a good feel for
  moods and the motivations of others.
  It's worth for them to engage in mental
  exercises.
  Their senses are considered good.




+3/+4
  "Sees into your soul" -- they say,
  and it's true. Always senses the
  "weak spot," it's worth listening to
  their instincts. Could become an excellent
  magic-user or have great insight into people.
  Possesses refined senses.




+5
  Such people perceive every tiny vibration,
  are extremely receptive to external moods.
  Could become a great people-reader or a great
  artist.
  Usually emotionally rich people,
  but for some, it's "just" a
  fantastic gift, without deeper
  emotions. These are the ones who
  become excellent diplomats,
  dreaded witches.
  Their senses are extremely refined.

## Spending Attribute Points

At the beginning of character creation, all your Attributes have a value of `-5`. In the first step, distribute `64` points among your eight Attributes according to the table below.



Attribute  |  Cost
    -5             -
    -4             1
    -3             2

     6*           26
     7*           33
64 points can be spent
   +1 point / 2 EL





- Only with racial modifier or magic


### Point Bonus After Experience Levels

Every `second` character level, you receive `+1` bonus point, which you can also spend on increasing your Attributes according to the table above.

Attention! You cannot increase an Attribute's value by one, but you receive this many points, from which you can afford an Attribute increase. You can also "save up" the bonus points you receive this way.

For example, increasing from `+3` to `+4` costs `4 points`, a bonus you can acquire over `8` Experience Levels of advancement.

---
### Explanation of Values

The value of Attributes can normally range from `-5` to `+5`. `-5` is, of course, the characteristic of the weakest, severely disabled characters, while those with a `+5` value are the heroes of legends, envied, or in worse cases, hated figures.

The above limits can be changed by [Race Background characteristics](021_faj_hatterek.md) or possible magical effects, but as a rule of thumb, **elf-like beings'** any attribute cannot increase above `+7` under any circumstances.

---
## Appearance, Emotional Characteristics

We leave the characteristics related to appearance and emotional "makeup" to the player, we do not assign additional values to them - they should be worked out during character creation, in consultation with the GM, and feel free to use the [Descriptive Backgrounds](022_leiro_hatterek.md) for this.

We believe that not all characteristics need to be quantified, and the above are partly freely determinable characteristics, so it mainly depends on the player's ability to immerse themselves in the character to what effect they have on other characters.

## Attribute Test



Attribute + d6  vs  Target Number


When a character finds themselves in a situation where one of their [Attributes](010_05_01_00_tulajdonsagok_listaja.md) needs to be tested—that is, knowledge related to a skill is not required—they must make an Attribute Test. This is done as follows:

The GM determines a Target Number from `3-8` as the Difficulty, and the player rolls a `d6`, adding the result to the value of their relevant **Attribute**. If the resulting number is greater than or equal to the Target Number, the test is successful. **Important**: rolls of `1` and `6` are **NOT** special values; they do not mean critical failure or success.



Attribute Test Target Number (d6)
3: Easy
4: Average
5: Difficult
6: Very Difficult
7: Extremely Difficult
8: Superhuman


---
### Degree of Success/Failure

⚜️ If you fail by `3` or more, you have made a particularly large mistake.

⚜️ If you succeed by `3` or more, the test was exceptionally successful.

The above failure/success has a narrative effect, which the player should narrate. If the GM dislikes the player's idea, they can overrule it.

<br />

---
### Effect of MPF on Physical Attribute Tests

Your armor can hinder you in performing physical **Attribute Tests**.

This is described by the [Armor Encumbrance](082_statuszok.md#%EF%B8%8F-armor-encumbrance-1-mpf-%EF%B8%8F-mpf) **Status**.

<br />

---
### Complex Attribute Test

If the character has to make a complex test that cannot be resolved with a single roll (e.g., a combined sequence of movements with multiple phases, or interpreting a complex, long-lasting, fluctuating emotional impulse with a **Perception** test), it would be unfair to make them roll against the maximum difficulty multiple times, as this would drastically reduce their chance of success. In such cases, we use the following method:

`1.` The player rolls a test against the justified maximum difficulty.



Example: "Very Difficult"
  → Target Number: 6


`2.` Then, they roll several (the GM decides how many) tests against a difficulty **one level lower**.



For example, 2 "Difficult" tests
  → Target Number: 5


This way, the distribution of success is much more gradual, and we also reward certain knowledge better, while preventing a beginner from "accidentally" succeeding at a long, detailed task far beyond their knowledge just because they got lucky with a roll.

How many secondary rolls are needed mainly depends on "how long" or "multi-step" the task is.

If we want a very fine breakdown, we can even have rolls against a difficulty `2` levels lower, like this:



1x "Very Difficult" (6)
1x "Difficult"        (5)
1x "Average"      (4)


<br />

---
### Example of a Complex Attribute Test

**⚡ Catching continuously falling plates**

**Filthy, the thief**



Dexterity: +2
Test: "Very Difficult" (6)


Since the task is quite complex and can be prolonged, it cannot be resolved with a single roll. The GM requires `1` Secondary test.

In this case, the target numbers for the tests are:



6: 50% chance
5: 66% chance
This gives about a 33% chance of success
( 0.5 * 0.66 )


It is clear that more complex tasks require greater certain knowledge. So the tests are:



1x "Very Difficult" (6)
1x "Difficult"        (5)


---
### Combined Tests

Similar to complex tests are Combined tests: a situation may arise where a character has to test multiple Attributes in a given situation. For example, they need to roll both a **Strength** and a **Dexterity** test.

In such cases, the GM determines the difficulty of the task and designates the **primary** Attribute, i.e., which is more dominant and important in the given situation. So, staying with the example above, whether **Strength** or **Dexterity** is more needed.

Then, the character should roll a test for the selected primary Attribute against the difficulty previously determined by the GM, and then another test for the **secondary** Attribute, with a difficulty one level lower than the above.

#### Important❗

The above number is not set in stone! If the GM feels the role of the secondary Attribute is even less important, they can reduce its Difficulty by `2` or `3`.

#### ⚡Example

Staying with the first example: if the task is "Very Difficult" (`6`) and the GM deems the **Strength** Attribute to be **primary** in the given situation, then the tests to be rolled are as follows:



Strength test: Very Difficult (6)
Dexterity test: Difficult   (5)


🔆Note:
If the GM thinks that in this case the Dexterity test is just a "minor addition," then the test to be rolled for it could be "Average" (`4`) or "Easy" (`3`).

---
### Opposed Attribute Test



Attribute + d6
      vs
Attribute + d6


If two characters have to measure their skills against each other in relation to a specific Attribute (for example, who can spin a coin on their hand longer), they must make an **Opposed Attribute Test**, which looks like this:

Both players (or the GM for an NPC) roll a `d6`, and add the result to the value of their respective Attribute. Whoever gets the higher number as a result, wins.

If the results are the same, a stalemate occurs. At the GM's discretion (perhaps after some time), a new opposed test can be rolled. If a stalemate is not possible in the given situation, they must roll a `d6` again (this time without adding the Attribute value) and the higher number wins.

---
### Effect of Injury on Attribute Tests

If the character is injured and falls into the `S3` or `S4` wound categories, they receive the ["Injured" Status](082_statuszok.md#%EF%B8%8F-injured-1-s3) and are affected by the effects described there on their attribute tests.

## File: md/010_06_szilank.md

## Shard

The **Shard**, mentioned earlier in the introduction of [Adventurers](010_03_00_karakter_jellemzoi.md), which slumbers in the soul, also appears in the gameplay. Its reality-shaping effect provides players with concrete advantages.

The Shard in the rule system is a point value that only and exclusively Adventurers receive, not NPCs - unless they are also Adventurers.

<br />

### What is it good for?

By spending one **Shard** (point), the player can modify narrative events in the adventure, even "bypassing" a dice roll.

Often, such a narrative modification in the adventure does not bring automatic success, but only creates an opportunity that the player may or may not be able to capitalize on.

<br />

### Gaining Shards



- At the start of an adventure: 1 Shard / PC
- Max: 3 Shards
- At the start of the next Adventure, it resets to 1


At the beginning of each adventure, the Shard value resets to `1`. Shards can be earned during the adventure if the GM deems that the player is faithfully role-playing their character's personality - slaughtering enemies does **not** count. This can be consistent acting, but also climactic scenes, important moments where - even against the party's interests - the player makes an important decision in line with their character's personality.

During an adventure:
- earning `1` new Shard is a big deal
- earning `2` Shards is an epic deed

<br />

---
### 🔆 Usage: Average intervention in the story: `1 Shard`

For one (`1`) Shard, you can make average changes to the story.

Examples:
- By chance, I happen to know the innkeeper from before.
- There are just enough horses for everyone when we switch to fresh mounts.
- The shopkeeper's ideal man happens to be the Player Character.
- I failed my **Insight** skill test, but yesterday I heard about this dwarf at the card table, that he loves gold jewelry.
- Fortunately, there happens to be a secret door in the inn's room. Important: just because it's there, you might not find it - for example, because you fail the Perception skill test.
- "I'm looking for a rare plant, can I roll **Wilderness Lore** to see if I find one." In a case where you normally wouldn't even be able to roll, because the plant is not native to this area.

<br />

### 🔆 Usage: Significant intervention in the story: `2 Shards`

Important: the `2` Shard cost CANNOT be combined from two different characters' points; one person must cover the entire cost!

Examples:
- "I just manage to overhear the dark mage - about his evil plans." GM: "Alright, you were very lucky, the mage says that..."
- There happens to be a secret door in the death cult's prison (this still needs to be found).
- "I failed my **Climbing** test again, I'm going to fall to my certain death. What if that goblin whose life I spared on the rock terrace just happens to throw down a rope?" GM: "Alright."

<br />

### 🔆 Usage: 1x Reroll: `1 Shard`

Once per game session, and only once, you can spend `1` Shard to repeat one of your rolls. In this case, the second roll counts - even if it is less favorable than the first.

<br />

---
### ⚜️ Method of collecting Shards: `1.` During the adventure

#### When can a Shard be earned during an adventure?

- `1.` The GM can offer it as a special situation where the player can earn a Shard. This is a disadvantageous turn for the Character, where they get into a difficult situation but can prove their mettle. If the Player accepts, the turn of events happens, and they receive a Shard.
- `2.` The PC suggests a difficult turn or situation. The GM then decides whether to accept the player's suggestion and thus the Shard acquisition.
- `3.` The PC creates a special situation on their own - not necessarily for the purpose of gaining a Shard - in which case the GM can reward them with a Shard afterward.

#### In which situations can a **Shard** be awarded?

- You perfectly play your character AND as a result, you get into a difficult situation. It's important that this applies to **you**, the character you are playing, not the whole party. This is important to emphasize because you can't accumulate Shards by selfishly messing with the entire party.
- An outstanding, epic moment. Typically, `1` such event occurs per adventure for a specific Player Character.
- If a scene occurs where multiple story threads converge and the Player Character plays an important role, they can even earn `2` Shards.
- For consistently good role-playing.

### 🌀 Advantages and disadvantages

**Good**, because it strives for heroic, epic fantasy storytelling and rewards legendary moments.

**Can be good**, because it introduces narrative complications through role-playing. That is: "if you dare to play out a trait of your character, you can complicate the plot with it." An important feature of narrative points is that they democratize storytelling by giving significant influence to the players. It is important that this gives power to the **PLAYERS**, not the **CHARACTERS**. The player decides whether they want to take the adventure in direction "**B**" instead of "**A**" in exchange for a Shard. So, the "Shard" fulfills its **narrative** function well. In short: by **acquiring** a Shard, I negatively influence the adventure for myself, and by **spending** it, I positively influence it.

**It can also have disadvantages**, because this type of game mechanic may be alien to many classic M* adventurers. Not only power-gamers are reluctant to play in a way that they intentionally "want bad things" for their own character. It's an old habit for players to be "protective" of their characters, so this kind of reward system might be unusual for many. This includes the fact that at its core, role-playing (especially M*) is often a power fantasy. Of course, this game mechanic can also have a positive, educational purpose.

<br />

---
### ⚜️ Method of collecting Shards: `2.` At the end of the game, retroactively

At the end of the Adventure, the GM and the players hold a review of the adventure, where they discuss for `5` minutes who best played out their character's personality, race, descriptive backgrounds, tradition, and nature. Based on this, the player's character receives `1` Shard at the beginning of the next game session (within the adventure).

### 🌀 Advantages and disadvantages

**Good**, because it encourages and rewards "good" role-playing, playing out the character. Additionally, it guarantees that someone will have an extra Shard every game session, not depending on whether a sufficiently significant event occurred in the adventure.

**It can also be a disadvantage**, because it does not reward heroic, epic fantasy moments.

**It can also be a disadvantage** because it does not reward narrative influence. The advantage of the `1st` method is that not only spending the Shard allows the player to influence the narrative, but also **acquiring** it.

<br />

---
### The party's decision at the beginning of the adventure: which model to use? `1.; 2.`

At the pre-adventure briefing, the party can decide which model they want to follow.

The `1st` model rewards heroic fantasy, the `2nd` rewards role-playing.

Each party can determine its own preference. From then on, they must follow the chosen model until the end of the adventure.

## Categories of Primary and Secondary Knowledge

In the `Shard` system, knowledge learnable with `CP` is divided into `2` arbitrarily defined categories. These are supplemented by a third, freely available one:



Primary
  Very useful in adventuring.
  Learnable with CP.
  (NOT with Secondary CP!)
Secondary
  Moderately useful in adventuring.
  Learnable with both CP and Secondary CP.
Free Feat
  Flavoring knowledge.
  1 is granted "for free" per level.


So, we can say that we have grouped knowledge according to its "power level." The reason for this is to encourage more colorful characters and to give a place to less "powerful" knowledge: to allow for the creation of colorful characters without putting them at a disadvantage against players who create gray "killing machines."

### Primary Knowledge

→ **Primary Skills**: for a list, see the "Primary Skills" section at the top of the [Skill List](030_01_kepzettseglista.md) page. Their notation: 🅿️

→ **Feats**: all combat, mystical, and magic feats

→ **Combat Modifier** (CM), **Aiming Modifier** (AM) points

---
### Secondary Knowledge

All other knowledge that is not Primary but also costs Character Points (`CP`). It's important that [Secondary CP](010_07_kp.md#character-points-cp) can only be spent on such knowledge, while "regular" CP can be spent on anything - even on Secondary knowledge.

## Health Points (HP)

For a detailed explanation, see the **Combat System**'s [Health Points](061_01_eletero_pont.md) chapter.

Every living being owes its distinction from ordinary objects to the physical and spiritual energy circulating within it, the life force. This energy gives life; if it leaves our body, we die. We simulate this with so-called **Health Points**. How many one has (how much more life force they possess) depends on the character's ⚪**Stamina** value. It is calculated as follows:



HP = 12 + (Stamina x 2)


---
## Fatigue Points (FP)

For a detailed explanation, see the **Combat System**'s [Health - Fatigue Points](061_02_faradsag_pont.md) chapter.

We use **Fatigue Points** (`FP`) for brawling, being knocked out, prolonged exhaustion, and illness.
Its effect is the same as losing `HP` (see the [Wounds](061_03_sebesules.md) chapter), but it cannot cause death as it does not involve structural damage.

1 FP: per hour while awake

[Maneuvers](066_00_manoverek.md) (like Leg Sweep, Disarm, Throw) are exceptions because they don't cost `CP`, anyone can attempt them by default.

**Maneuver Points** can be used optionally during the [Opposed Test](066_04_manover_vegbevitele.md#%EF%B8%8F3-opposed-test-e) phase of maneuvers in-game to make them easier.

For their description, see the [Maneuver - Maneuver Points](066_02_manover_pontok.md) chapter.

## Non-Player Characters

Non-Player Characters, or "NPCs," are figures that appear during the story who are personified and controlled not by the players, but by the GM. Their goals and thoughts are also determined by the GM and are unknown to the players (unless, of course, the NPC decides to share them, or they are extracted by some coercive means).



Skill limits do not apply to NPCs!


### NPC Levels

A simple peasant can reach an Experience Level of `5-6` in their old age. This, of course, does not automatically result in an increase in combat values, as in the `Shard` system, only what we spend on grows. An exception to this is the [Subconscious Magic Resistance](103_aura_magia_akarata_magiaellenallas.md) (`SMR`), which slowly increases on its own with experience and age.

## Race Characteristics

 The chosen **Race Background** above serves as a framework that encompasses all the unique characteristics of each race, which are detailed below:

---
## `1.` Attribute Frames

Every race has its physical and mental limits. Sometimes this elevates them above the average, or just the opposite.
Attribute frames set a possible minimum/maximum for each [Attribute](010_05_01_00_tulajdonsagok_listaja.md).

Example:



[-2; +6] Stamina


---
## `2.` Maximum Acquirable Sense-Feats

If a player chooses a Race Background for their character, they are required to take at least **1 degree** of one of the possible [Sense-Feats](043_altalanos_fortelyok.md#sense-feats) listed for that race, spending `CP`.

So, for example, if they wanted to save on `CP`, they could create an **orc** character who only has "**Infravision - 1st degree**" Sense-Feat. They would not have exceptionally good smell or hearing and would not receive bonuses underground. This is possible, as not all individuals of a race are the same.

The player is given the opportunity to start with an individual blessed with a variety of special senses (see the description of the respective Race Background for the limits), but it will cost a lot of CP - the choice is theirs.

---
## `3.` [Race Mystery](030_01_kepzettseglista.md#race-mysteries-🅿️) Skill

An **optional**, primary 🅿️ skill that specifically reaches out to the mystical/magical, ancient roots of the given race.

It provides knowledge derived only from certain knowledge, which at higher levels increasingly result in semi-magical effects. Taking it is **optional**, not mandatory.

Example: [Race Mystery: Dwarf](kepzettsegek.faj.miszterium/faj_miszterium_torpe.md)

---
## `4.` Race Arcanum Skill

Also a primary 🅿️ and optionally acquirable skill, its requirement is the Race Mystery skill.

Each Yn3vian race is connected to a specific magical [Arcanum](106_magikus_szferak_arkanumok.md) (e.g., Amund: Astral Magic). Multiple races can be connected to the same Arcanum - but in the form of different abilities.

The aforementioned Arcanum provides the race's mystical abilities, rooted in its origin. The higher the level of the race's Arcanum, the closer the individual of that race gets to its ancient origins.

The individual levels may have requirements.

⭕TODO⭕ `1` spellcasting [Form](045_misztikus_magia_fortelyok.md#spellcasting-forms) must be taken from a given "Form pool".

---
## `5.` Racial Feats

Usually specialized, non-mystical knowledge characteristic of the given race.

---
## `6.` Forbidden Knowledge, Limitations

What knowledge the character cannot acquire if they choose this race, or if they can, what limitations apply.

---
## `7.` Recommended Feats

Not mandatory, but feats that are typically common for the given race.

---
## `8.` Recommended Skills

Not mandatory, but skills that are typically common for the given race.

## Karma Backgrounds

<!-- tag: karma__feat -->

Karma Backgrounds are special character traits whose requirements are not numerical, but rather some event, special deed, or the repetition of a regular habit. Thus, Karmas can only be "acquired" during adventures. Their effect also appears on the character's Aura. They are always given by the GM; the player cannot take them voluntarily, nor can they demand them from the GM.

We can acquire Karma from two sources:

- From the specific list of karmas described here below, if the requirements are met.
- From unique Karmas invented by the GM (here, the storyteller should grant them wisely).

The Karmas listed below do not necessarily cover everything. If the GM feels that a new Karma invented by them would fit the atmosphere of the current adventure, they can grant it, but they should be mindful of the power balance: only give a flavoring knowledge as a Karma, not numerical advantages.

Karmas can be standalone or characterized by a percentage.

In competitions and clubs, only the Karmas described here can be given by the GM after consultation with the player!

<br />

### 🟡 Blessed Person

You have received the blessing of a divine entity or a holy place for some heroic deed. If not concealed, it is visible on your Aura.

You receive the [Blessed](082_statuszok.md#%EF%B8%8F-blessed--cursed-12-attribute) Status.

Effect:
- Pro: In certain situations, you have supernatural luck, or minor miracles happen around you.
- Con: The blessing can be lost if you become unworthy of it.

<br />

---
### 🟡 Blessing Bearer

You carry the effects of a powerful entity, which can have positive (mostly) and negative effects for you.

The blessing / otherworldly entity connected to your Aura does not primarily exert its effect on your person - it is not specifically for you; you just carry it.

It is mainly activated in your environment or in relation to persons or places that meet certain conditions. If not concealed, it is visible on your Aura.

<br />

---
### 🟡 Cursed Person

You have been cursed by a divine entity or a holy place for some unspeakable villainy. If the curse is not concealed, it is also visible on your Aura.

Until the curse is lifted, you receive the [Cursed](082_statuszok.md#%EF%B8%8F-blessed--cursed-12-attribute) Status.

It can have very diverse effects, typically a narrative element invented by the GM.

<br />

---
### 🟡 Curse Bearer

You carry the effects of a powerful entity, which can have positive and (mostly) negative effects for you.

The curse / otherworldly entity connected to your Aura does not primarily exert its effect on your person - it is not specifically for you; you just carry it.

It is mainly activated in your environment or in relation to persons or places that meet certain conditions. If the curse / entity is not concealed, it is visible on your Aura.

E.g., An Aquir relic that you can't get rid of. Or "Orwella's touch."

<br />

---
### 🟡 Alcoholic

#### Requirement

No comment 🙂

#### Effect

After a while, it shows on your behavior and appearance - this also affects your social life. You are unable to function without alcohol and will do anything to get it. During withdrawal, you may receive `Disadvantage-1,2` penalties on Attribute and Skill tests.

<br />

---
### 🟡 Shadow Walker

You have spent a long time hiding, operating in the shadows, moving unnoticed.

- Pro effect: You can hide and sneak more easily; the shadows almost become your allies. [Stealth/Hiding](kepzettsegek.primer.altalanos/lopakodas_rejtozes.md) in complete darkness: `+3`
- Con effect: People have a hard time trusting you and often look at you with suspicion. If you try to achieve a positive effect or emotion with your [Influence](kepzettsegek.primer.altalanos/befolyasolas.md) skill, you receive a `-3` penalty on your roll.

<br />

---
### 🟡 Champion

#### Requirement

Similar to a hero, but you don't necessarily have to be good or noble. Your heroic deeds are limited to a single group. You are the group's hero, single-handedly bringing glory to / protecting / leading the group to victory. Example: Achilles.

#### Effect

Your mere presence is inspiring. All your followers receive an `Advantage+1` Effect on their Magic Resistance rolls against Astral/Mental effects.

<br />

---
### 🟡 Wise Teacher

You have helped several characters to develop, taught or mentored them for a long time.

Effect:
- Pro: Your students respect you and are willing to help you. Your wisdom makes it easier to gain recognition and trust.
- Con: If one of your students betrays you or fails, it also damages your reputation.

---
### 🟡 Fallen Healer

#### Requirement

As a priest, you attempted to resurrect the dead, but unfortunately, the operation turned into Necromancy; the soul had already departed, and you forcibly pulled it back.

#### Effect

You will never again be able to heal by laying on of hands; you can no longer use the [Wound Healing](magia.papi.varazslatok/sebgyogyitas.md) formula. The operation leaves a visible stain on your Aura.

<br />


---
### 🟡 Child Killer

#### Requirement

You intentionally killed a child.

#### Effect

This karma is indelible, a clearly visible, filthy stain of shame on your Aura. Depending on the story, it may also be associated with a bad reputation. If it becomes known, you will suffer negative effects depending on the culture. Ostracism, lynching...

<br />

---
### 🟡 Killer

#### Requirement

At least 100 successful assassinations.

#### Effect

The numerous murders have poisoned your soul. If you do not conceal it, dark spots that stain it are clearly visible on your Aura.

You cannot heal through magical means; the higher, semi-magical effects of the worldly [Medicine](kepzettsegek.primer.altalanos/orvoslas.md) and [Herbalism](kepzettsegek.szekunder/vajakossag.md) skills also do not work.

<br />

---
### 🟡 Infamous

#### Requirement

You have participated in numerous high-profile cases where your name and face were mentioned.

#### Effect

Your reputation precedes you. If you are loitering around the area of your active operations, there is a good chance you will be recognized... and not just by fans... A `%` roll decides, the chance is determined by the GM.

<br />

---
### 🟡 Hero

#### Requirement

You always help those in trouble, you are always ready for self-sacrifice, you always act for a good cause. Anyone who performs many heroic deeds receives this Karma.

#### Effect

**Pro**: Many people recognize you and immediately have a positive attitude towards you, which can also bring concrete advantages: for example, you will never have trouble finding accommodation, they will be more willing to answer your questions, and so on.

**Con**: Just one serious bad deed, and you lose the karma, which you can never regain! Then, a **Fallen Hero** karma is your reward...

<br />

---
### 🟡 Servile

You have spent considerable time alongside powerful people; you feel good next to (under) them. You feel a constant urge to suck up.

#### Effect

Against **Influence** skill tests directed at you by "great people," you can only roll for **Insight** with a `Disadvantage-1` penalty.

<br />

---
### 🟡 Child of Nature

You have spent a long time in the wilderness and have developed a close connection with nature.

Not tied to a specific region (!)

#### Effect

- Pro: You get by more easily in nature: you are lucky, and animals are generally friendlier towards you.
- Con: You have a harder time adapting to the urban environment, and people may find some of your habits strange.

<br />

---
### 🟡 Worldly

You have traveled to many different places in the world and have proven your competence through adventures.

#### Effect

You adapt more easily to new situations and environments. This effect is not quantified; if necessary, you can draw the GM's attention to it.

<br />

---
---
### 🟡 Magic: Aura Harmony

#### Requirement
Backstory, previous adventures.

#### Effect

You gain a magical karma. For example:
- Wizard in the rain (`30%`)
- Wizard in a crowd (`20%`)
- Wizard in the dark (`100%`) - a secret, degenerate sect whose members are blind and can only cast spells in the dark.
- etc.

See the Magic chapter, [Magical Components, Harmonies](105_magikus_komponensek_osszhangok.md) for more details!

<br />

---
### 🟡 Magic: Profane

A magical karma.

#### Requirement
- "Ties his shoelaces with magic."
  Handles every little trivial matter with magic, just to avoid having to move 🙂
- Not applicable to Priestly magic.

#### Effect

**Pro**:
- You can cast small, low-Strength (max `3`) spells with `-3` Complexity, as their use has become so customary and practiced.

**Con**:
⭕TODO⭕
- Strength: above `6`, every additional `1 level` increase counts as `2 levels`.
- You are not capable of using Ritual magic.⭕

## Race Mystery: Amund

<--- Description goes here --->

⭕TODO⭕



- Astral Magic == level of "Race Mystery: Amund"
- Priestly Magic == level of "Race Mystery: Amund"


Astral Magic functions as a special ability.

### Requirements

- pure-blooded amund descent
- [Ultra Vision - level 2](../fortelyok.erzekek/ultralatas.md) feat
- there are no versions of the special amund abilities that work without this skill

⭕TODO⭕ Adapt to skill levels

The amund character receives the [Astral Magic](../kepzettsegek.primer.arkanumok/asztralmagia.md) Arcanum for free at the same level as this skill, which they can use instinctively from `level 3`. Its use is special: the effect does not come from Mana, but from sacred energies. The reason for this special ability lies in the Amunds' close connection with the astral plane.

Important: they can only use one formula at a time, they cannot combine them as mosaics!

Its advantage is that, for example, the Mana Siphon Metamagic formula cannot be used on it, as no Mana focusing occurs, and it can also be used in Mana-dead areas.

If the amund character wants to become a priestly magic user, they must increase the "Race Mystery: Amund" skill to at least `level 6`, which is equivalent to the Priestly Magic tradition.

Furthermore, they must properly learn every Sphere. The two abilities cannot be combined!

### [Mental Magic](../kepzettsegek.primer.arkanumok/mentalmagia.md), as a special psionic ability

- `Mental Magic level == ("Race Mystery: Djinn" level) - 8`
- The djinn is capable of conjuring Mental Magic mosaics not from Mana, but from their psionic energies. The reason for this special ability lies in the Djinns' close connection with the mental plane. Important: they can only use one formula at a time, they cannot combine them as mosaics!
- Its advantage is that, for example, the Mana Siphon Metamagic formula cannot be used on it, as no Mana focusing occurs, and it can also be used in Mana-dead areas.
- Mental Magic, as a special psionic ability, is NOT the Mental Magic of High Magic or Vulgar Magic, but a unique "djinn" Mental Magic Arcanum.
- It has unique, "djinn-like" formulas, as with every tradition. Let it be weaker (perhaps), or have a narrower scope.
- Djinn priests use the Soul sphere (?how does this fit here?)

⭕TODO⭕ A further advantage of the skill is that they are also able to use "Kyr" wizardly psionic disciplines (⭕Astral Eye/Mental Eye, etc⭕) from `level 3`.

⭕TODO⭕ Adapt to skill levels

### High Magic and Mental Magic

If the djinn takes the [High Magic](../051_01_magasmagia.md) tradition at least at `level 3`, then their **Race Mystery: Djinn** skill can be counted/used as a Mental Magic Arcanum, they do not need to take it twice. In this case, the Mental Magic formulas are naturally created using mana focus. The two abilities cannot be combined!

### Unique Djinn Disciplines

#### Mind Wipe
⭕I think this is a Power Word! See Summarium example story. SHOULD NOT be acquirable⭕

"Race Mystery: Djinn" levels (certain knowledge (⭕or should it be a test?)):
- level 6 - basic requirement, max wiping of today's memories, 50% chance they return
- level 9 - max 2 weeks wiped, 30% chance they return
- level 12 - max 1 year wiped, 10% chance they return
- level 15 - max all memories wiped permanently, they never return

## File: md/kepzettsegek.primer.altalanos/befolyasolas.md

## 🔵 Influence

This is a [Primary Skill](../010_09_primer_szekunder_ismeretek.md). Test, opposed test can be rolled.

It covers persuading others and achieving actions that align with our intentions. By default, it's simple argumentation, but it can be **extended** to other situations with the Feats below.

### Dominant Attributes

Intelligence, Perception

### Defense against it (Related)

- [Insight](emberismeret.md) skill

### Normal Extension

- [Haggling](../fortelyok.szabad/alkudozas.md): "What? It's not worth half that! Do I look like a half-wit?"
- [Sleight of Hand](../fortelyok.szabad/buveszet.md): "As you can see, the card has been consumed by fire... hmm... it seems, my lord, that your dear wife's lace frills still hold it intact!"
- [Seduction](../fortelyok.altalanos/csabitas.md): You turn the other's head. Their tongue loosens quickly, for love is blind. Non-magical effect.
- [Lying](../fortelyok.altalanos/hazudozas.md): "They went that way! Oh, my leg!"
- [Intimidation](../fortelyok.altalanos/megfelemlites.md): "It would be a shame for this beautiful waistcoat, blood is hard to get out of it..."
- [Oratory](../fortelyok.szabad/szonoklas.md): "What do you choose? The lying, fat lord who has never held a scythe, or me, who also comes from a riverside village?"

### Strong Extension

- [Taming Domestic Animals](../fortelyok.szabad/haziallatok_idomitasa.md): "Spot, heel... turn!"
- [Taming Wild Animals](../fortelyok.szabad/vadallat_idomitasa.md) 🔁: "Dance, Bruin!"

### Situations

- [Taming an animal, beast](../szituaciok/allat_bestia_idomitasa.md)
- [Methods of Influence (Influence vs. Insight)](../szituaciok/befolyasolas_modszerei.md)

<br />

### Opposed Tests

**Influence** is always in an opposed test situation with the **[Insight](emberismeret.md)** skill - with modifiers depending on the situation, so there's no point in listing individual tests. The most common test situation is:



Influence + Intelligence
            vs
Insight + Perception


### 🔆 Role-playing Modifier

The party decides at the beginning of the game whether to apply this parameter.

The player acts out the influence attempt in person. Depending on the quality of the performance/dialogue, the GM gives a modifier in the range of `[-3;+3]`, and the player adds this to their **Influence** skill test.

For example, if the player doesn't put much energy into personifying their character or into the idea with which they want to deceive the other party, meaning they want to feed them a very transparent lie, they can easily get a `-3` penalty on the roll.

<br />

---
### Master Bonuses

#### 🌟 `Level 9`

If you want, you can draw the attention of a room full of people just with your presence. The effect is as if you shouted - but without a word.

#### 🌟 `Level 12`

The effect of your Aura, with the power of certain knowledge (you can't roll for it), applies to the target person or crowd. If your Aura prevails, you get `Advantage+1` on your skill test.

#### 🌟 `Level 15`

The effect of your Aura, with the power of certain knowledge (you can't roll for it), applies to the target person or crowd. If your Aura prevails, you get `Advantage+2` on your skill test.

<br />

---
### Target Number Modifying Circumstances

- Trying to influence in a language the target person(s) do not understand: `+3`
- Certain [Statuses](../082_statuszok.md) may cause negative [effects](../081_hatasok.md) on **Social Skill Tests**.

## File: md/kepzettsegek.primer.altalanos/emberismeret.md

## 🔵 Insight

This is a [Primary Skill](../010_09_primer_szekunder_ismeretek.md). Test, opposed test can be rolled.

### Dominant Attributes

Perception, Intelligence

### Related

- [Influence](befolyasolas.md) skill
- [Etiquette](../kepzettsegek.szekunder/etikett.md) skill

### Normal Extension

The following Feats can only be taken upon reaching `level 3` of the skill!
- [Haggling](../fortelyok.szabad/alkudozas.md): "I'm sorry, sir, but this is **real** cotton; not even a blind beggar would give it away for the price you're offering."
- [Seduction](../fortelyok.altalanos/csabitas.md): You notice that the approach of the opposite sex is not entirely innocent, you suspect a hidden intention.
- [Lying](../fortelyok.altalanos/hazudozas.md): "Please, I wasn't born yesterday."
- [Interrogation](../fortelyok.szabad/kihallgatas.md): "Get lost. I'm not falling for such cheap tricks."
- [Intimidation](../fortelyok.altalanos/megfelemlites.md): "Waving your sword is useless, sir, I cannot let you in without a white handkerchief."
- [Oratory](../fortelyok.szabad/szonoklas.md): "Another charlatan... The barn he's boasting about to the crowd wasn't built by him, but by old Lord Beard, the chamberlain."

### Situations

- [Methods of Influence (Influence vs. Insight)](../szituaciok/befolyasolas_modszerei.md)

**Description**: The "science" of mapping other people's behavior, mood, and understanding their inner motivations. The acquisition of this knowledge is mostly guided by LIFE with a capital L. Many conversations, sometimes bitter experiences.

The skill is special in that (similar to combat styles) `level 3` provides the "base level," meaning an average adult has this much insight. Those with a lower value fall into the categories of "unlucky sucker" and "gullible fool" in common parlance.

At higher levels, you can also exert therapeutic effects to alleviate mental problems.

In specific, special situations, the above Feats can provide help (Seduction, etc.).

<br />

### Master Bonuses

#### 🌟 `Level 9`

⭕TODO⭕

#### 🌟 `Level 12`

A new astral sense opens up for you, with which you can determine if changes in personality traits or emotional states are of magical origin, provided they are not concealed. Yes/No.

#### 🌟 `Level 15`

Detecting magical intervention behind an average personality change.
- **Therapy**: in just a short conversation, you can eliminate the effect of [Status: Trauma (1,2)](../082_statuszok.md#%EF%B8%8F-trauma-1-soul-fracture).
- **Example**: astral mage
- Special: Your eyes have opened to the Astral Plane, and you are capable of perceiving there as well. ⭕TODO: Astral Eye⭕

<br />

### Opposed Tests

**Insight** is always in an opposed test situation with the **[Influence](befolyasolas.md)** skill - with modifiers depending on the situation. The most common test situation is:



Influence + Intelligence
            vs
Insight + Perception


For more details, see: [Situations: Influence vs Insight](../szituaciok/befolyasolas_modszerei.md) chapter.

### Active Tests 🎲

In this case, Insight acts as a kind of "radar," trying to draw conclusions based on various signs. This can be a conscious or unconscious investigation; the point is that the user or their personality is not being externally influenced by others (see Passive Tests), but they are perceiving certain signs.

🔆 **Special**: the target person's `Willpower` attribute is added to (or subtracted from, if negative) the difficulty!

🔆 **Base case**: one minute of conversation

#### Easy (6) 🎲

Noticing conspicuous, superficial emotional states. You can judge how much they are actually paying attention to you - whether they are just politely nodding or are genuinely interested in what you have to say.

#### Average (9) 🎲

Recognizing basic, unconcealed personality traits.

#### Difficult (12) 🎲

- With an open partner, recognizing their deeper personality traits, mental distortions.
- You can assess team dynamics with a single roll. You feel who the "leader" is, whose opinion you need to influence primarily.
- Sensing the precursors to emotional outbursts.

#### Very Difficult (15) 🎲

- In any conversation, you automatically sense who is the most easily swayed party. Not how, but who can be most easily influenced.
- You recognize mental problems and can begin to heal them. ⭕TODO: healing mental problems; Therapy: [Status: Trauma (1,2)](../082_statuszok.md#%EF%B8%8F-trauma-1-soul-fracture): You can alleviate `1` degree of it over weeks.

#### Extremely Difficult (18) 🎲

- ⭕TODO⭕ To be revisited when magic is developed.

#### Superhuman (21) 🎲

- ⭕TODO⭕ To be revisited when magic is developed.
- ⭕Sensing that the other party's personality is likely under the influence of an otherworldly being.
- ⭕Recognizing a "corruption of the fetus" vulgar magic spell.

<br />

---
### Target Number Modifying Circumstances

- Shorter/Longer contact time and/or deeper/less deep than the base case: `[-3;+3]`
- The target person is of a different race: `+3`
- Effect of Astral Eye: ⭕TODO⭕

## File: md/kepzettsegek.primer.altalanos/eszleles.md

## 🔵 Perception

This is a [Primary Skill](../010_09_primer_szekunder_ismeretek.md). A test can be rolled.

**Related main chapter**: [Sensing, Perception](../szituaciok/erzekeles_eszleles_aktiv_passziv.md)

Perception is about noticing something. This could be a flashing dagger, an assassin hiding in the foliage, an incriminating scuffing sound. It's important that Perception only means noticing the moment, not interpreting it! That is the player's task, which can be facilitated by skills like [Investigation](nyomozas.md) or [Wilderness Lore](../kepzettsegek.szekunder/termeszetjaras.md).

<br />

### Dominant Attributes

- Perception (this is also used for physical senses)
- Intelligence

### Related

- [Alert Sleeper](../fortelyok.altalanos/eber_alvo.md) feat
- [Infravision](../fortelyok.erzekek/infralatas.md) feat
- [Lightning Search/Hide](../fortelyok.altalanos/villamgyors.kereses.rejtes.md) feat

### Normal Extension

- [Search/Hide](../fortelyok.altalanos/kereses_rejtes.md): Noticing/hiding tracks in an urban environment. "That table has been moved." / "It's drafty by this wall."

### Situations

- [Sensing, Active/Passive Combat Perception](../szituaciok/erzekeles_eszleles_aktiv_passziv.md)
- [Stealth/Hiding and its Perception](../szituaciok/lopakodas_rejtozes_es_eszlelese.md)

### Master Bonuses

#### 🌟 `Level 9`

Experienced bounty hunter. You feel it if someone is persistently watching you without magical concealment, even if you can't see them.

#### 🌟 `Level 12`

Elite, royal bodyguard. You can smell the unconcealed presence of strong magic or Aura: for precise interpretation and direction, other skills are needed, but you can feel whether the energy is positive or threatening.

#### 🌟 `Level 15`

Martial arts grandmaster, mage.
- New senses open up to you in mystical form. ⭕TODO⭕
    - ⭕Aura?

    - ⭕Mental Eye?
    - ⭕Danger?
    - ⭕Infra, ultra?

- You are able to sense danger even when there is no audible/sensible sign – it's practically a pre-emptive intuition.

<br />

## 🔵 Poison Mixing

This is a [Primary Skill](../010_09_primer_szekunder_ismeretek.md). A test can be rolled, but failure is hidden; the player only realizes the failure when the poison is applied (it has no effect).

See also the [Poison System](../150_meregrendszer.md) main chapter!

You know the methods and recipes for mixing poisons of various effects and strengths. At higher levels, you are able to create increasingly complex and sophisticated mixtures.

### Levels

The determination of the [shelf life, dissipation, and duration of effect](../151_meregkeveres_szabalyai.md#3-shelf-life--dissipation) of poisons also requires **certain knowledge**. For more details, see there.

### Master Bonuses

#### 🌟 `Level 9`

⭕TODO⭕ You can roll a **Perception** skill test for poison detection without using your physical senses (sight, smell, taste). You don't even have to drink or smell the poisoned drink; with a successful test, you simply sense the poison.

#### 🌟 `Level 12`

Your touch is poisonous, but only if you want it to be. Your sweat, saliva, and in extreme cases, your blood become poisonous to others. A kind of "poison-body control." ⭕TODO⭕ What complexity, etc., of poison?⭕
- If you touch someone, you can automatically administer a small dose of poison to them – this is always a small dose from your own repertoire (e.g., paralyzing, weakening).
- You can incorporate small doses of poisons compatible with your own body (those you have prepared) into your body without them taking effect, and later release them through your skin.

#### 🌟 `Level 15`

⭕TODO⭕ You become immune to all types of poison. If you are Kr4nian, you can create Banarat.

<br />
